[groups]
# group1 = *.collab.net
# othergroup = repository.blarggitywhoomph.com
# thirdgroup = *.example.com

### Information for the first group:
# [group1]
# http-proxy-host = proxy1.some-domain-name.com
# http-proxy-port = 80
# http-proxy-username = blah
# http-proxy-password = doubleblah
# http-timeout = 60
# neon-debug-mask = 130
# store-plaintext-passwords = no
# username = harry

### Information for the second group:
# [othergroup]
# http-proxy-host = proxy2.some-domain-name.com
# http-proxy-port = 9000
# No username and password for the proxy, so use the defaults below.

### You can set default parameters in the 'global' section.
### These parameters apply if no corresponding parameter is set in
### a specifically matched group as shown above.  Thus, if you go
### through the same proxy server to reach every site on the
### Internet, you probably just want to put that server's
### information in the 'global' section and not bother with
### 'groups' or any other sections.
###
### Most people might want to configure password caching
### parameters here, but you can also configure them per server
### group (per-group settings override global settings).
###
### If you go through a proxy for all but a few sites, you can
### list those exceptions under 'http-proxy-exceptions'.  This only
### overrides defaults, not explicitly matched server names.
###
### 'ssl-authority-files' is a semicolon-delimited list of files,
### each pointing to a PEM-encoded Certificate Authority (CA)
### SSL certificate.  See details above for overriding security
### due to SSL.
